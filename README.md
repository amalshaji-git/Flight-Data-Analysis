# Flight Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
The Flight Data Analysis project is a comprehensive exploration and analysis of flight-related data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights in the aviation industry. This project applies data science techniques to analyze flight data, covering aspects such as delays, airline performance, and flight patterns. The findings can help improve operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and strategic planning for airlines.

## Project Objectives
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns in flight data.
- Analyze flight delays and identify contributing factors such as weather, airline performance, and time of day.
- Visualize flight patterns to better understand the frequency and distribution of flights.
- Predict potential delays based on flight and external variables.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following structure:
- **data/**: Contains the flight dataset in CSV format.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, analysis, and model building.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data cleaning, analysis, and predictive modeling.
- **output/**: Visualizations, summary tables, and reports generated during analysis.

## Key Features and Steps
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and formatted timestamps.
   - Engineered features such as delay categories, flight duration, and average delay times.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed flight frequencies by airline, destination, and time of day.
   - Visualized delay distributions and explored relationships between delays and factors like weather, airline, and flight duration.
   - Used heatmaps, line plots, and bar charts to uncover patterns in delays and operational performance.

3. **Flight Delay Analysis**:
   - Examined different types of delays (e.g., carrier delay, weather delay, NAS delay) and identified primary causes.
   - Quantified the impact of each factor on total delay time, providing insights into areas for improvement.

4. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - **Classification Models**: Built a classification model to predict whether a flight will be delayed or on-time based on input features.
   - **Regression Models**: Used regression to predict delay duration, focusing on feature importance to highlight main contributors.
   - **Feature Engineering**: Included factors such as day of the week, weather conditions, and airline-specific data to improve model accuracy.

5. **Data Visualization**:
   - Created visualizations for flight paths, delays by destination, delay trends, and average delay times.
   - Mapped out flight routes and frequency to visualize the busiest routes and airports.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Data Manipulation: `Pandas`, `NumPy`
  - Visualization: `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Plotly`
  - Machine Learning: `scikit-learn`

## Results
- Identified key factors contributing to flight delays, with specific insights into weather and operational delays.
- Built a delay prediction model that achieves satisfactory accuracy, providing potential value in delay mitigation strategies.
- Visualizations offered actionable insights, such as peak delay times and high-frequency routes, aiding in operational planning.

## Challenges
- Managing data inconsistencies across different data sources.
- Handling class imbalance in delay prediction tasks.
- Optimizing the predictive model for accurate delay forecasting.

## Conclusion
The Flight Data Analysis project highlights important trends and insights in flight operations and delays. The findings and predictive models can aid airlines and airport management in optimizing scheduling, improving customer satisfaction, and reducing delays.
